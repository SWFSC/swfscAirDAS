Testing pkgdown

This package contains functions for processing and analyzing aerial
survey DAS data (AirDAS) generated by TURTLEP and associated programs at
the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. Functionality includes reading
AirDAS data into a data frame, processing this data (extracting state
and condition information for each AirDAS event), and summarizing
sighting and effort information. Plans for future development include:
generating tables summarizing the information in the AirDAS file,
plotting AirDAS data, and generating files needed for doing density
estimation.

## Installation

You can install `swfscAirDAS` from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("smwoodman/swfscAirDAS")
```

## AirDAS format

You can [download the
PDF](https://github.com/smwoodman/swfscAirDAS/blob/master/inst/AirDAS_Format.pdf)
describing the AirDAS data format requirements of `swfscAirDAS`.

## Usage

First, you must read and process the AirDAS data

``` r
library(swfscAirDAS)
# Get file paths of sample files included in the package
y <- system.file("airdas_sample.das", package = "swfscAirDAS")
y.eff.randpicks <- system.file("airdas_sample_randpicks.csv", package = "swfscAirDAS")

# Read and process AirDAS file, i.e. read AirDAS data into a data frame and add info columns
y.read <- airdas_read(y)
y.proc <- airdas_process(y.read)

# Alternatively, the file path can be passed directly to airdas_process
y.proc <- airdas_process(y)
```

Note that `airdas_read` can read multiple files simultaneously

``` r
y.read.mult <- airdas_read(c(y, y))
```

Then you can summarize the processed AirDAS data

``` r
# Summarize sighting information
y.sight <- airdas_sight(y.proc)

# Chop continuous effort sections into effort (modeling) segments, 
#   and summarize information for each segment
y.eff <- airdas_effort(y.proc, 3, sp.codes = c("mn", "bm", "qq"), randpicks.load = y.eff.randpicks)
y.eff.segdata <- y.eff[[1]]
y.eff.siteinfo <- y.eff[[2]]
y.eff.randpicks <- y.eff[[3]]
```
